## A useless Hex color code saver extension for Firefox


- Pre-visualize Hex color
- Save the Hex code in LocalStorage
- Copy the code in one click :sparkles:

## Why :question:

As a web developer, i was always strugling with Hex color codes, having tons of tabs open with different colors palette and code. Ending losing them, and myself in a sea of dosen tabs.

So i decided to make my own firefox extension to answer to my own first problem, saving Hex color codes without losing them between other notes or in the Clipboard.
It result in this Extension, that is not the Must-have for a web developper, but that save me a lot of time and mental health. :triumph:
